## Future Work

### Phase 11 — Color Customization

- Status: Not started (`0/6`)
- Dependency: Phases 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (already complete)
- Scope: user-configurable priority colors and dashboard section background styling
- Blocking decision: implement now or explicitly mark this phase as skipped

## Unphased Backlog

- Dynamic priority levels (user-defined)
